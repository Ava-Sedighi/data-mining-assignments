# Data Mining Course Assignments (Spring 2024)

This repository contains all homework assignments completed for the **Data Mining** course at Sharif University of Technology. These projects demonstrate the practical application of fundamental data mining and machine learning techniques using Python.

## Key Topics & Skills Demonstrated

| **Data Preparation** | Data Cleaning, Missing Value Imputation (Mean, Median, Model-based), Data Transformation, Handling Skewness, Outlier Detection. |
| **Descriptive Analysis** | Measures of Central Tendency & Dispersion, Data Visualization, Distance Metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, Jaccard). |
| **Pattern Mining** | **Apriori Algorithm** for Association Rule Mining (Frequent Itemset Generation, Support, Confidence, Lift). |
| **Classification** | **Decision Trees**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest**, and **Naive Bayes**. |
| **Evaluation** | Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, **AUC-ROC** Analysis, Threshold Optimization. |
| **Clustering & Recommendation** | **K-Means Clustering**, **Hierarchical Clustering (Single Linkage)**, Expected Value Analysis for business recommendations. |
| **Tools & Libraries** | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn. |
